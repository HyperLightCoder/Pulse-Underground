# The Pulse Underground

**Decentralized • Censorship-Resistant • Real-Time News & Messaging on PulseChain**

> No one can stop you from posting whatever you want.  
> No one can silence you.  
> Welcome to The Pulse Underground.

## Vision

**The Pulse Underground** is a fully decentralized social news and messaging platform built natively on **PulseChain**.  

Instead of relying on centralized servers, databases, or Web2 platforms that can censor, shadow-ban, or shut you down, Pulse Underground turns **zero-value transactions** into immutable public posts and private channels.

Every message is embedded directly in the blockchain as transaction data. The entire feed is pulled from the public PulseScan API. There are no servers, no moderators, no accounts, and no single point of failure.

This is freedom of speech at the protocol level.

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Post via Transactions** — Type a message → send 0-value tx with UTF-8 text in the data field
- **Channels = Addresses** — Every PulseChain address functions as a channel/room
- **Main Channel** — Global public feed
- **Self Channel** — Your personal inbox (only shows messages **sent to** your address)
- **Custom Channels** — Join any address instantly

### Smart Feed Experience
- **Incoming-Only Filtering** — Self Channel never shows your outgoing messages
- **Infinite Scroll** — Automatically loads older history when you reach the bottom
- **Background Live Updates** — Polls every 2 minutes without refreshing the page
- **"New Stories Available" Button** — Twitter/X-style notification at the top
- **Dynamic Gas Estimation** — Always uses the cheapest safe gas limit
- **Local Profile** — Username + avatar URL (stored in browser)
- **Instant Search** — Filter posts by content or reporter
- **IndexedDB Caching** — Lightning-fast reloads and offline-ish feel

### Freedom & Privacy
- Fully client-side (single HTML file)
- No backend, no database, no KYC
- Censorship is impossible as long as PulseChain lives

## How It Works (Technical Breakdown)

1. Connect your PulseChain wallet
2. Select a channel (Main / Self / Custom address)
3. Write message → encoded as `data` in a 0-value transaction
4. App scans transaction history of the channel address via PulseScan API
5. Filters to **only incoming** transactions (`to === channel`)
6. Decodes `raw_input` from hex to UTF-8 text
7. New messages detected via background polling

**To post in your own Self Channel** → simply send the transaction to yourself.
